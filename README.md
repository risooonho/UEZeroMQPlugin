# PluginZeroMQ
UE4 ZeroMQ Plugin

This Plugin maps functions from the ZeroMQ Library to Blueprints-Functions in UE4.

# Compiling third party libs

In \Plugins\UEZeroMQPlugin\Source\ThirdParty you find some scripts to automate some task. For libsodium and libzmq this will run successfully. 
For libczmq you have to call the vs2015 project map explicitly and batch build only the libs.


# Status
Still Work in Progress (WIP).
